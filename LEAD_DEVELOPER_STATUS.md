### **API Endpoints Structure**
```javascript
GET  /api/status              // System status and counts
GET  /api/components          // Extracted Figma components  
GET  /api/design-tokens       // Design system tokens
GET  /api/ai-designs          // AI-generated designs
POST /api/scan-figma          // Scan Figma design file
POST /api/generate-ui-library // Generate UI library
POST /api/generate-ai-design  // Generate AI design
```

## 📋 **Delegation Strategy**

### **Agent Coordination Protocol**
1. **Status Updates**: Every 2 hours during active development
2. **Git Workflow**: Feature branches with agent-specific naming
3. **Quality Gates**: TypeScript compilation, build success, basic testing
4. **Communication**: Shared documentation updates and commit messages

### **Critical Path Dependencies**
1. **Agent #1** must complete GitHub setup before others can collaborate
2. **Agent #3** needs API keys configured before testing integrations
3. **Agent #4** depends on Agents #2 & #3 completing core features

### **Escalation Triggers**
- API integration failures
- Major architectural decisions needed
- Cross-agent task dependencies
- Security or performance concerns
